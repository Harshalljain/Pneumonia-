# Pneumonia
# Pneumonia detectection using web app 
The main aim of this project is the detection of pneumonia by Chest X Rays in a flask web application to display the results.
# Background
Pneumonia is an infection that inflames the air sacs in one or both lungs. The air sacs may fill with fluid or pus (purulent material), causing cough with phlegm or pus, fever, chills, and difficulty breathing. Pneumonia can range in seriousness from mild to life-threatening. It is most serious for infants and young children, people older than age 65, and people with health problems or weakened immune systems. It is curable disease especially if detected in the early stages.

Signs and symptoms of pneumonia vary from mild to severe, depending on factors such as the type of germ causing the infection, and your age and overall health

    Chest pain when you breathe or cough
    Confusion or changes in mental awareness (in adults age 65 and older)
    Cough, which may produce phlegm
    Fatigue
    Fever, sweating and shaking chills
    Lower than normal body temperature (in adults older than age 65 and people with weak immune systems)

Most common causes of pneumonia are bacteria and viruses(COVID 19) in the air we breathe. Pneumonia is classified according to the types of germs that cause it and where you got the infection for example Community acquired (outside of hospitals or other health care facilities), Hospital acquired or Aspiration acquired.

Chest radiographs are preferred for diagnosis of pneumonia as they are less expensive than CT scans and show both - presence and visual depiction of the spread of the disease unlike blood tests. In addition, a chest X-ray can be used to diagnose many conditions and diseases such as pleurisy, pulmonary edema, pneumonia, bronchitis, cysts, tumours, cancers, asthma, pericarditis, cardiomegaly, heart failure, pneumothorax, and rib fractures.

# Drawbacks of previous problem, solution to this problem


    Diagnosis manifests as an area(s) of increased opacity on a chest radiograph (CXR) which needs to be reviewed by highly trained specialists.

    Although very common and curable, accurately diagnosing pneumonia is difficult

    Challenges faced in diagnosis using CXR are-
        Lung conditions : fluid overload (pulmonary edema), bleeding, volume loss (atelectasis/collapse), lung cancer, or post-radiation.
        Outside of the lungs, fluid in the pleural space (pleural effusion) also appears as increased opacity on CXR.
        Positioning of the patient and depth of inspiration High workload on radiologist.

Thus, there is a requirement for a faster method to predict pneumonia using a CXR.

So this project will be very useful to automatically locate lung opacities on chest radiographs and predict if the patient is suffering from pneumonia through a user friendly web app.
